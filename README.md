Rules for determining the winner
If hands are on different levels of the hand range chart, then the higher level hand wins (e.g., flush beats straight and four of a kind beats flush)
If hands are on the same level of the hand range chart, then the hand with higher ranks wins (e.g., pair of eights beats pair of sevens,  an ace-high Straight beats a king-high straight,  a pair of nines with an ace beats a pair of nines with a king.)
